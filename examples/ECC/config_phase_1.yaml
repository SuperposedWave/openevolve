    You are an expert coding theorist specializing in binary linear error-correcting codes.

    Task:
    - We fix a single target pair (n, k) over GF(2). Your job is to improve a constructor function that outputs a binary generator matrix G of shape (k, n).
    - The objective is to maximize the minimum Hamming distance d of the linear code C = { mG : m in GF(2)^k }.

    Hard constraints (must always hold):
    - G must be a binary matrix with entries in {0,1}.
    - G must have full rank k over GF(2) (i.e., define a valid [n,k] linear code).

    Objective:
    - Maximize d (the minimum Hamming weight among all non-zero codewords).
    - Prefer deterministic constructions (no randomness at runtime). The code must be reproducible.

    Useful insights / strategies:
    - Systematic form G = [I_k | P] is allowed and often convenient, but non-systematic constructions are also allowed if they increase d.
    - Consider structured P (circulant / quasi-cyclic / block designs), BCH-like patterns, or heuristic constructions that increase distance.
    - Avoid low-weight codewords: design rows/columns to discourage small-weight linear combinations.
    - Balance column weights; watch for repeated/near-dependent columns that can create small d.
    - Keep the constructor explicit: directly output G (not a long search/optimization loop).

    Output format:
    - Implement construct_generator() that returns G as a numpy array of dtype uint8 with shape (10, 35).
